This is Markdown Oxide's nickname. 

It used to be Moxide, but I am thinking of changing it to MXIDE. 

1. It looks cool :)
2. Pronounced *moxide*, it is of course reference to Markdown Oxide
3. Markdown Oxide is somewhat like a mark(X:up,down) IDE
    - similar to the esteemed GHCIDE, a haskell development environment built on the Glasgow Haskell Compiler :)
