# What is Markdown-Oxide?

- ^whatIsMarkdownOxide

    Markdown-Oxide is a [[Personal Knowledge Management System|Personal Knowledge Management System(PKM)]] that composes with your favorite text-editor through the [Language Server Protocol(LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/). 
    
    While other PKMs implement their own text-editors, markdown-oxide is *unbundled*: it leaves text-editing to a dedicated text-editor and focuses solely on robust, performant knowledge management.
